# Javascript Practice Reduce
Quick challenege to encourage deeper understanding of Javascript's `reduce` [function.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reduce-f47a7da511a9/).

Deeply inspired by [hiquest's javascript exercises](https://github.com/hiquest/jsex)

## Setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/jorge0136/reduce-javascript-practice`
2. `cd reduce-javascript-practice`
3. `yarn install`

## Implement Challenege

Here you should implement the `reduceIt` function within reduce.js`.
Note that the function is named `reduceIt` in order to avoid any conflict with the
native `reduce` function.

## Test Implementation

`yarn test` will run the specs, giving a pass or fail.
